# HVDC-Transmission-Project-Location-Analysis
High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Transmission Project Location Analysis

README:

These data and code correspond to the manuscipt "Undergrounding is associated with a four-year faster High Voltage Direct Current transmission buildout", an original research work by the Climate Innovation Initiative at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). 

The output dataset (HVDC_Projects_out_EDF_2024.csv) contains the relevant variables and data for the HVDC projects explored in the manuscript. 

The analysis is contained in the code script jupyter notebook (Undergrounding_Analysis.ipynb) located here and publicaly available on GitHub (https://github.com/bwalkowiak/HVDC-Transmission-Project-Location-Analysis) for viewing. 

Necessary input data to run the script are contained in the input file (hvdc_projects_input_EDF_2023.xlsx) in addition to the HVDC transmission lines (hvdc_routes.[type]) which were not publicly abailable, so were generated in ArcMap. Additional publicaly available data used for figure generation are highlighted in the code script and here:
